### Hackathon Project Proposal: AI-Powered FAQ and Release Notes Generation Portal

**Project Title**: **AI-Powered FAQ and Release Notes Generation Portal**

**Team Members**:
1. Mustafa Saifee (Primary AI Developer, Documentation)
2. Rishika (Lead Developer, API Integration)
3. Jyoti (Presentation and Coding Support)

**Project Overview**:
Our project aims to develop an automated portal for generating FAQs and release notes using Vertex AI. This system will integrate with existing tools such as Jira and Slack to streamline the documentation process, enhance efficiency, and maintain high-quality content with automated grammar checks.

**Key Features**:
1. **Automated FAQ Generation**:
   - FAQs will be generated based on Jira tickets.
   - Vertex AI will analyze Jira tickets to create relevant FAQ entries automatically.
   - Weekly FAQ answers will be extracted from Slack channels to assist the Customer Success team, Sales team, developers, and the product team.
   - This feature will reduce the manual effort involved in FAQ documentation.

2. **Automated Release Notes Generation**:
   - The portal will generate release notes based on predefined triggers and inputs.
   - This ensures timely and accurate release documentation.

3. **Grammar Checks**:
   - Automated grammar checks for all content generated by Vertex AI.
   - Ensures high-quality, error-free documentation.

4. **Integration with Existing Tools**:
   - The system will integrate with Jira for ticket information.
   - It will also support integration with Slack for accessing specific channel conversations.
   - Secure and compliant access to these tools will be managed with the required clearance from the SecOps team.

**Technologies Used**:
- **Frontend**: Next.js (JavaScript/TypeScript framework)
- **Backend**: Python (Flask for API development)
- **AI/ML**: Vertex AI for natural language processing and automated content generation
- **Deployment**: Docker for containerization [OPTIONAL], Kubernetes for orchestration [OPTIONAL], and GCP as the cloud provider
- **Version Control**: GitHub for code repository and version control

**Implementation Plan**:
1. **Phase 1: Requirements Gathering and Initial Setup**
   - Gather detailed requirements and finalize the project scope.
   - Set up the development environment and tools.
   - Research and understand Vertex AI capabilities and integration points.
   - Obtain necessary access and permissions from the SecOps team.

2. **Phase 2: Development**
   - **Frontend Development**: Create a user-friendly interface using Next.js.
   - **Backend Development**: Develop APIs using Flask to handle data processing and integration.
   - **AI Integration**: Integrate Vertex AI to handle automated FAQ and release notes generation.
   - **Grammar Checks**: Implement automated grammar checks for generated content.

3. **Phase 3: Testing and Refinement**
   - Conduct thorough testing of all features.
   - Refine the system based on feedback and test results.

4. **Phase 4: Deployment and Presentation**
   - Containerize the application using Docker. [OPTIONAL]
   - Deploy the application on a Kubernetes cluster using GCP. [OPTIONAL]
   - Prepare a comprehensive presentation for the hackathon, highlighting key features, challenges, and achievements.

**Challenges and Considerations**:
- **Data Privacy and Security**: Ensuring secure and compliant access to Jira, Slack, and GitHub data.
- **AI Integration**: Effectively training and utilizing Vertex AI to provide accurate and contextually appropriate responses.
- **Scalability**: Designing the system to handle increasing volumes of data and user requests.

**Conclusion**:
This project aims to leverage AI to automate and streamline the documentation process, saving time and reducing errors. By integrating with existing tools like Jira and Slack and utilizing advanced AI capabilities, our portal will significantly enhance productivity and documentation quality. We believe this project not only showcases our technical skills but also addresses a real need within our organization, making it a valuable addition to our workflow.

**Scoping Questions**:
1. Are there any additional specific permissions or integrations we might need to consider for Jira, Slack, or GitHub?
2. Are there any specific metrics or KPIs that stakeholders expect us to track for the FAQ and release notes generation?
3. Are there any specific formatting requirements for the generated FAQs and release notes?

Feel free to provide additional information or ask further questions to help refine this proposal!
